# Language Constructor
Making a constructed language (or conlang for short) is a huge time investment. The goal for this project is to automate the random and repeated processes involved in the creation of a conlang.

## Project status
I've only just started the first aspect: creating a proto-language. A table of initial phonemes, a word order, a set of irreducible root words, and more need to be selected before evolving this proto-language into satisfactory conlang. I've implemented a basic structure of phoneme objects, as well as a short script to randomly select vowel phoneme based on their prevalence rates in natural languages. Indeed, at the moment this project is no more than a random selector and doesn't have much practical use.

I am intent on eventually implementing the generation of protolanguages, but the evolution of a proto-language into a satisfactory conlang is an ambitious undertaking I am not confident in completing with my limited understanding of language. Perhaps I will complete this project if I find an interested collaborator that is experienced in the creation of conlangs.
